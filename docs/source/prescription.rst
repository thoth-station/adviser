Declarative prescriptions for resolver
--------------------------------------

The implementation of the recommendation engine allows to declaratively specify
:ref:`pipeline units <unit>` that should be included in the :ref:`resolver
pipeline <pipeline>` without actually implementing any code.  The document
below describes core mechanics behind creating such "prescriptions" for the
resolver.

.. note::

  Check `thoth-station/prescriptions <https://github.com/thoth-station/prescriptions>`__
  repository that provides prescriptions for open-source Python packages.

  See also `this pull request
  <https://github.com/thoth-station/adviser/pull/1821>`__ for a reference on how
  to implement specific pipeline unit type that extend resolver functionality.
  A high level overview can be found in `the following YouTube video
  <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK1qYdhmquY>`__.

One can see prescriptions as `enhanced constraints
<https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/user_guide/#constraints-files>`_ but on the
server side. This way constraints can be generalized and applied also for
multiple projects for which server-side resolution can provide guidance.

.. note::

  The declarative prescription interface allows to quickly provide pipeline units
  that assist the resolution process but have limited expressive capabilities.
  For more sophisticated pipeline units one can still use the programmable
  interface.

Prescriptions structure
=======================

Prescriptions are written in a form of YAML files that are maintained in a Git
repository. An example of such directory structure can be found at
`thoth-station/prescriptions <https://github.com/thoth-station/prescriptions/>`__.

The repository keeping prescriptions must state a metadata file keeping generic
information for prescriptions. This file is named
``_prescription_metadata.yaml`` and metadata stated in this file are inherited
to all units declared in sub-directories living besides the metadata file.

The content of the metadata file is (an `example
<https://github.com/thoth-station/prescriptions/blob/b12d31510134a08b47e621c08d8d69977641b903/prescriptions/_prescription_metadata.yaml>`__):

.. code-block:: yaml

  prescription:
    name: <name>
    release: <release>

Value stated in ``prescription.name`` acts as a namespace for prescriptions. If
you use multiple prescriptions, you do not need to worry about any naming
collisions unless you make sure these prescriptions live in a separate
namespace (have different values of ``prescription.name``).

The identifier stated in ``prescription.release`` states release information
about prescriptions.

.. note::

  Check the resolution log to see what prescriptions in which versions are used
  during the resolution process.

Each sub-directory keeps information about prescriptions. It is a convention to put
package specific prescriptions into sub-directories which match package names.
Any generic or package agnostic prescriptions can be placed into
sub-directories prefixed with and underscore (e.g. ``_generic``). Name of the
YAML files are then determined based on the unit semantics written there.

.. note::

  If you are a package maintainer or you would like to follow updates for a
  specific set of prescriptions, you can add yourself to `CODEOWNERS
  <https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/creating-a-repository-on-github/about-code-owners>`__
  file and follow updates only for a specific sub-directory.

    </div>

Unit schema
===========

Units are stated in ``units`` listing in the corresponding YAML file respecting
unit's base type:

.. code-block:: yaml

  units:
    boots: []
    pseudonyms: []
    sieves: []
    steps: []
    strides: []
    wraps: []

Each unit, regardless of its type, has the following schema:

.. code-block:: yaml

  name: '<unit_name>'
  type: '<unit_type>'
  should_include:
    <should_include_section>
  match:
    <match_section>
  run:
    <run_section>

The semantics behind entries:

``name``
########

Name of the unit that uniquely identifies the unit of the specific type.

All the units created based on prescription live in their own namespace that is
specified by the ``name`` of the prescription. This makes sure unit names do
not clash across multiple prescriptions supplied.

``type``
########

Type of the unit, one of ``boot``, ``pseudonym``, ``sieve``, ``step``,
``stride`` and ``wrap``.

Including a unit - ``should_include``
=====================================

``should_include.times``
########################

Number of times the given unit should be included in the resolution process.

Possible values:

* ``1`` - the given pipeline unit should be included once in the resolution
  process if all the criteria for including it match (default)

* ``0`` - the given pipeline unit will not be included in the resolution
  process - the given pipeline unit is off even thought it is stated in the
  YAML file

``should_include.adviser_pipeline``
###################################

Boolean stating whether the given pipeline pipeline unit will be part of
"adviser" pipeline used for computing Thoth's recommendations.

Possible values:

* ``false`` - the given pipeline unit will not be part of the resolver pipeline
  when computing advises (default)

* ``true`` - the given pipeline unit will be part of the resolver pipeline
  when computing advises

``should_include.recommendation_types``
#######################################

A list of recommendation types that should be matched if the unit is registered
for the adviser resolution pipeline.

Alternatively, the list can be wrapped to a "not" statement which inverts
the logic.

If ``adviser_pipeline`` is set to ``false``, this configuration option has no
effect.

See `the listing of recommendation types available
<https://thoth-station.ninja/recommendation-types/>`__.

``should_include.dependency_monkey_pipeline``
#############################################

Boolean stating whether the given pipeline pipeline unit will base part of
:ref:`Dependency Monkey <dependency_monkey>` pipeline used for `data
acquisition and generation on Amun
<https://github.com/thoth-station/amun-api/>`__.

Possible values:

* ``false`` - the given pipeline unit will not be part of the resolver pipeline
  used for Dependency Monkey (default)

* ``true`` - the given pipeline unit will be part of the resolver pipeline
  when running Dependency Monkey

``should_include.decision_types``
#################################

A list of decision types that should be matched if the unit is registered for
the :ref:`Dependency Monkey <dependency_monkey>` resolution pipeline used for
`data acquisition on Amun <https://github.com/thoth-station/amun-api/>`__.

Alternatively, the list can be wrapped with a "not" statement which inverts
the logic.

If ``dependency_monkey_pipeline`` is set to ``false``, this configuration
option has no effect.

``should_include.library_usage``
================================

Library calls that should be present to include the pipeline unit. This
creates an ability to include a pipeline unit only if some parts of a
library are used that affect the application.

.. note::

  *Example:*

  .. code-block:: yaml

    library_usage:
      # from flask import Flask
      flask:
        - flask.Flask
      # Match if anything is imported from tensorflow.keras.
      tensorflow:
        - tensorflow.keras.*

The use of libraries is statically checked using on client side
`invectio library <https://github.com/thoth-station/invectio>`__.

``should_include.dependencies``
###############################

Dependencies on other pipeline units. All the stated pipeline units have to be
registered (``should_include`` has to be evaluated as ``true``) as listed
dependencies are pre-requisites to register the stated pipeline unit.

.. note::

  *Example:*

  .. code-block:: yaml

    should_include:
      dependencies:
        boots:
          - thoth.ExampleBoot
          - CoreBoot

  This part of the ``should_include`` section is specific to a unit that states
  dependencies on two units of type :ref:`boot <boots>`. ``ExampleBoot`` is a boot
  pipeline unit from prescription named ``thoth`` and ``CoreBoot`` is a boot
  provided by the adviser Python implementation (corresponds to a name of the
  Python class).

Referencing unknown units evaluates always to ``false``.

If no dependencies are stated, the given pipeline unit is not dependent on
any pipeline unit.

``should_include.dependencies.boots``
#####################################

A list of :ref:`boot pipeline units <boots>` that need to be present in the
resolution process. Referenced by respective unit name and optional
prescription name for referencing units from prescriptions (see above for more
info).

``should_include.dependencies.pseudonyms``
##########################################

A list of :ref:`pseudonym pipeline units <pseudonyms>` that need to be present
in the resolution process.  Referenced by respective unit name and optional
prescription name for referencing units from prescriptions (see above for more
info).

``should_include.dependencies.sieves``
######################################

A list of :ref:`sieve pipeline units <sieves>` that need to be present in the
resolution process.  Referenced by respective unit name and optional
prescription name for referencing units from prescriptions (see above for more
info).

#####################################

A list of :ref:`step pipeline units <steps>` that need to be present in the
resolution process.  Referenced by respective unit name and optional
prescription name for referencing units from prescriptions (see above for more
info).

``should_include.dependencies.strides``
#######################################

A list of :ref:`stride pipeline units <strides>` that need to be present in the
resolution process.  Referenced by respective unit name and optional
prescription name for referencing units from prescriptions (see above for more
info).

``should_include.dependencies.wraps``
#####################################

A list of :ref:`wrap pipeline units <wraps>` that need to be present in the
resolution process.  Referenced by respective unit name and optional
prescription name for referencing units from prescriptions (see above for more
info).

Labels - ``should_include.labels``
==================================

Labels introduce a mechanism to register pipeline units only for requests that
state the given label. An example can be a CI system that is asking for an
advise and labels the request with ``requester=ci_foo``. In such a case, the
resolution engine includes pipeline units that are specific to the CI system
(besides the ones that are added by default or matching other labels stated
in the request).

.. note::

  *Example:*

  Register the given pipeline unit if ``team=thoth`` or ``requester=ci_foo``
  were provided:

  .. code-block:: yaml

    labels:
      team: thoth
      requester: ci_foo

.. raw:: html

    <div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; height: auto;">

    </div>

Runtime environments - ``should_include.runtime_environments``
==============================================================

Matching runtime environment configurations for which pipeline units should be
included in the resolution process. This configuration section is meant for
units that are specific for runtime environments.

``should_include.runtime_environments.operating_systems``
#########################################################

A list of operating systems for which the pipeline unit should be included.
Each entry optionally states ``name`` (operating system name) and ``version``
(operating system version). Not providing any of the two means matching *any*
value.

.. note::

  *Example:*

  .. code-block:: yaml

    operating_systems:
      - name: rhel     # matches Red Hat Enterprise Linux in any version
      - name: fedora   # matches Fedora in version 33
        version: 33

``should_include.runtime_environments.hardware``
################################################

Matching hardware available when running the application. This
configuration basically creates a matrix of hardware that should be
available on user's side to register the given pipeline unit in the
resolution process.

Alternatively, the list can be wrapped with a "not" statement which inverts
the logic.

.. note::

  *Example:*

  .. code-block:: yaml

    hardware:
      # Matches any GPU or no GPU available and
      # CPU family 1 CPU model 9 or CPU family 2 and CPU model 8.
      - cpu_families: [1, 2]
        cpu_models: [9, 8]

      # Matches CPU family 1, CPU model 9 running on GPU "Foo" or GPU "Bar",
      - cpu_families: [1]
        cpu_models: [9]
        gpu_models:
          - Foo
          - Bar

      # Matching any CPU family except for 1.

``should_include.runtime_environments.python_packages``
#######################################################

A list of Python packages that should or should *not* be present
in the runtime environment in order to register the given pipeline unit.

Information about Python package can be specified using the following fields.

* ``name`` - mandatory, name of the package (e.g. ``jupyterhub``)

* ``version`` - package version specifier (e.g. ``~=1.4.1``)

* ``location`` - a regular expression describing where the given package should
  be installed. An example use of this option is detecting Python packages
  that are installed inside Python s2i environment. The regular expression is
  matched using
  `re.fullmatch <https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#re.fullmatch>`__.

If ``version`` is not provided, any version present registers
the given pipeline unit.

If ``location`` is not provided, any location is considered. Note that the detection
of Python packages does not enforce their availability on ``PYTHONPATH``.

.. note::

  *Example:*

  .. code-block:: yaml

    python_packages:
      # Register if jupyterhub~=1.4.1 is present in s2i virtualenv
      # and micropipenv<=1.1.0 is installed regardless of its location.

Boots
=====

Declaring :ref:`pipeline units of type boot <boots>`.

The following example shows all the configuration options that can be applied
for a boot pipeline unit type. See respective sections described below for more
info. Also note, the example shows all the options that can be supplied and is
not semantically valid (not all options can be supplied at the same time
semantically):

.. code-block:: yaml

  name: BootUnit
  type: boot
  should_include:

Pseudonyms
==========

Declaring :ref:`pipeline units of type pseudonym <pseudonyms>`.

The following example shows all the configuration options that can be applied
for a pseudonym pipeline unit type. See respective sections described below for more
info. Also note, the example shows all the options that can be supplied and is
not semantically valid (not all options can be supplied at the same time
semantically):

.. code-block:: yaml

  name: PseudonymUnit
  type: pseudonym
  should_include:                                   # See should_include section.
  match:                                            # Criteria to trigger run of this pipeline unit. Defaults to always running the pseudonym pipeline unit if no package_version is provided.
    package_version:
      name: flask                                   # Mandatory, name of the package for which pseudonym should be registered.
      version: '>1.0,<=1.1.0'                       # Version specifier for which the pseudonym should be run. If not provided, defaults to any version.
      index_url: 'https://pypi.org/simple'          # Package source index for which the pseudonym should be run. If not provided, defaults to any index. Can be negated using "not".
      develop: false                                # If specified, match development or not development dependencies.
  run:
    log:                                            # Optional text printed to logs when the unit gets called.
      message: "Some text printed to log on pipeline unit run."
      type: "WARNING"

    stack_info:                                     # Information printed to the recommended stack report.
      - type: WARNING
        message: "Hello, world"
        link: https://thoth-station.ninja           # A link to justifications or a link to a web page.

    yield:
      # Pseudonym that should be registered.
      yield_matched_version: true                   # If set to true, use version that was matched instead of the one provided in the locked_version part.
      package_version:
        name: flask                                 # Mandatory, name of the pseudonym package.
        locked_version: '==1.2.0'                          # Version of the pseudonym in a locked form.
        index_url: 'https://pypi.org/simple'        # Package source index where the pseudonym is hosted.

The pseudonym is registered for the specified criteria. The unit derived out of
this declarative prescription will make sure the package yielded is known to
the resolver.

Pseudonym ``run.log``
#####################

Print the given message to logs if the pipeline unit is included and run.

See :ref:`boot's log <boot_run_log>` that has shared semantics.

Pseudonym ``run.stack_info``
############################

See :ref:`stack info <boot_stack_info>` which semantics is shared with this unit.

Note stack info is added only once even if the pipeline unit is
run multiple times during the resolution process.

Pseudonym ``match``
#######################

Package described in ``package_version`` field that should be matched by three
entries:

* ``name`` - mandatory, name of the package for which the pseudonym should be
  provided
* ``version`` - optional, version in a form of version specifier for which the
  pseudonym should be provided
* ``index_url`` - optional, Python package index URL for which the pseudonym
  should be provided. Can be negated using "not".
* ``develop`` - optional, if provided it additionally specifies if the dependency
  should or should not be a development dependency

See examples below for more info.

It is also possibly to match the given pseudonym pipeline unit for multiple packages
by providing a match listing.

.. note::

  *Example:*

    .. code-block:: yaml

      name: PseudonymUnit
      type: pseudonym
      should_include:
        times: 1
        adviser_pipeline: true
      match:
        - package_version:
            name: tensorflow
            index_url: "https://pypi.org/simple"
        - package_version:
            name: tensorflow-gpu
            index_url: "https://pypi.org/simple"
            develop: false
      run:
        stack_info:
          - message: "Considering also intel-tensorflow and tensorflow-gpu as an alternative to tensorflow"
            type: "INFO"
            link: "https://pypi.org/project/intel-tensorflow"

        yield:
          yield_matched_version: true
          package_version:
            name: intel-tensorflow
            index_url: "https://pypi.org/simple"


Pseudonym ``run.yield``
#######################

Description of a package that should be yielded. Made out of two entries:

* ``yield_matched_version`` - yields version that was matched based on version
  specifier in the ``match`` section, defaults to ``false``
* ``package_version`` - description of a package that should be yielded

  * ``name`` - mandatory, name of the package that should be yielded
  * ``locked_version`` - optional, disjoint with ``yield_matched_version``;
    describes locked version of the package that should be yielded
  * ``index_url`` - optional, Python package index to be used to provide
    pseudonyms

If no version provided or no index explicitly set, all found in the database
(analyzed by Thoth) are yielded.

.. note::

  An example pipeline unit that suggests ``intel-tensorflow`` coming from PyPI
  as an alternative to ``tensorflow``:

  .. code-block:: yaml

    name: PseudonymUnit
    type: pseudonym
    should_include:
      times: 1
      adviser_pipeline: true
    match:
      package_version:
        name: tensorflow
        index_url: "https://pypi.org/simple"
    run:

          type: "INFO"
          link: "https://pypi.org/project/intel-tensorflow"

      yield:
        yield_matched_version: true
        package_version:
          name: intel-tensorflow
          index_url: "https://pypi.org/simple"

Step ``match``
##################

Match the given step performed in the resolution process. A step is described
by state stating all the resolved dependencies so far and package that is
about to be resolved:

* ``package_version`` - package that is about to be resolved by adding it to
  the resolver's state

  * ``name`` - optional, name of the package
  * ``version`` - optional, version in a form of version specifier
  * ``index_url`` - optional, Python package index URL, can be negated using ``not``
  * ``develop`` - optional, if provided it additionally specifies if the dependency
    should or should not be a development dependency


* ``state`` - internal resolver's state with resolved dependencies

A state that needs to be met to trigger the given step pipeline. The state
states resolved dependencies where each entry in the resolved dependency
listing is described as:

* ``name`` - optional package name that has to be stated in the resolved
  dependency listing
* ``version`` - optional package version in a form of version specifier that
  has to be stated in the resolved dependency listing
* ``index_url`` - optional package index from which the given package is
  consumed, can be negated using ``not``

To run the given step, all the packages in the resolved dependency listing
need to be present in the resolved software stack. Also both ``state`` and
``package_version`` need to be matched.

It is possible to provide a listing of matching criteria to run the given
pipeline unit multiple times.


.. note::

  *Example:*

  .. code-block:: yaml

  # Match when torch (not dev) in a 1.9.0 compatible release from PyPI is
  # about to be included into resolver's state with torchvision==0.9.0 from PyPI.
  match:
    package_version:
      name: torch
      version: "~=1.9.0"
      index_url: "https://pypi.org/simple"
      develop: false
    state:
      resolved_dependencies:
        name: torchvision
        version: "==0.9.0"
        index_url: "https://pypi.org/simple"

  # Match when torch in a 1.9.0 compatible release *not* from PyPI is about to
  # be included into resolver's state with torchvision==0.9.0 *not* from PyPI.
  match:
    package_version:
      name: torch
      version: "~=1.9.0"
      index_url:
        not: "https://pypi.org/simple"

Boolean stating whether the given unit should be run if criteria match multiple
times per resolution run. Defaults to false.

.. _step_run_justification:

Step ``run.justification``
##########################

Optional justification added to the resolved stack when the pipeline unit is
run. This justification is added only if no ``not_acceptable`` and no
``eager_stop_pipeline`` are supplied - if the given step is a valid step in the
resolution process. See :ref:`justification` for more info on how to write
justifications and their semantics.

Each entry in the list is specified by three attributes:

* ``type`` - any of ``INFO``, ``WARNING``, and ``ERROR`` specifying severity of
  the produced info
* ``message`` - a message in free text form printed to users
* ``link`` - a link to a document describing more information in detail

The link can be in a form of a valid HTTP or HTTPS URL or a string which
:ref:`references justifications <jl>` available at
`thoth-station.ninja/justifications
<https://thoth-station.ninja/justifications>`__.

.. note::

  *Example:*

  .. code-block:: yaml

    name: StepUnit
    type: step
    should_include:
      times: 1
      adviser_pipeline: true
    match:
      package_version:
        index_url: 'https://thoth-station.ninja/simple'
    run:
      score: +0.1
      justification:
        - type: INFO
          message: "Builds available on index thoth-station.ninja/simple take precedence"
          link: "https://thoth-station.ninja/"

Step ``run.score``
##################

Optional score addition to penalize or prioritize resolving the given stack.
Score has to be from interval -1.0 to +1.0 inclusively.

See :ref:`justification <step_run_justification>` for an example.

Step ``run.not_acceptable``
###########################

Make the given step not acceptable in the resolution process.

.. note::

  *Example:*

  A pipeline unit that filters out any ``tensorflow~=2.4.0`` when
  ``numpy==1.19.1`` is in already resolved dependencies.

  .. code-block:: yaml

    name: StepUnit
    type: step
    should_include:
      times: 1
      adviser_pipeline: true
    match:
      package_version:
        name: numpy
        version: "==1.19.1"
        index_url: 'https://pypi.org/simple'
      state:
        resolved_dependencies:
          # Considering builds available also on other indexes than PyPI.
          - name: tensorflow
            version: '~=2.4.0'
    run:
      multi_package_resolution: true
      not_acceptable: "NumPy==1.19.5 is causing issues when used with TensorFlow 2.4"
      stack_info:
        - type: WARNING
          message: "NumPy==1.19.5 is causing issues when used with TensorFlow 2.4"
          link: "https://thoth-station.ninja/j/tf_24_np.html"

Step ``run.eager_stop_pipeline``
################################

If the given pipeline unit is registered and matched, it will cause the whole
resolution to halt and report back any results computed.

.. _skip_package_step:
SkipPackageStep
===============

A step that removes the given package considering also
resolver's internal state. This pipeline unit is more
expensive than `SkipPackageSieve`_
which does not have capability of checking resolver's state.

.. note::

  *Example:*

  .. code-block:: yaml

    name: SkipPackageStep
    type: step.SkipPackage
    should_include:
      adviser_pipeline: true
    match:
      package_version:
        name: scipy
        version: "==1.4.0"
        index_url: 'https://pypi.org/simple'
      state:
        resolved_dependencies:
          - name: tensorflow
            version: '==2.1.0'
            index_url: 'https://pypi.org/simple'  # Not directive can be used.
    run:
      log:
        message: "Removing scipy package accidentally included as a dependency of TensorFlow"
        type: "WARNING"

      stack_info:

Strides
=======

Declaring :ref:`pipeline units of type stride <strides>`.

The following example shows all the configuration options that can be applied
for a stride pipeline unit type. See respective sections described below for more
info. Also note, the example shows all the options that can be supplied and is
not semantically valid (not all options can be supplied at the same time
semantically):

.. code-block:: yaml

  name: StrideUnit
  type: stride
  should_include:                                   # See should_include section.
  match:                                            # Criteria to trigger run of this pipeline unit. Defaults to always running the boot pipeline unit if no package_version is provided.
    state:                                          # Optional, resolver internal state to match for the given stride.
      resolved_dependencies:
        - name: werkzeug                            # Dependencies that have to be present in the resolved state.
          version: "~=1.0.0"                        # Version specifier specifying version range.
          index_url: 'https://pypi.org/simple'      # Index URL used when consuming the release. Can be negated using "not".
  run:
    log:                                            # Optional text printed to logs when the unit gets called.
      message: "Some text printed to log on pipeline unit run."
      type: "WARNING"

    stack_info:                                     # Information printed to the recommended stack report.
      - type: WARNING
        message: "Hello, world"
        link: https://thoth-station.ninja           # A link to justifications or a link to a web page.

    not_acceptable: "Bad package inclusion"         # Block resolving the given stack.

    # Configuration of prematurely terminating the resolution process.
    eager_stop_pipeline: "Stop pipeline"

Stride ``match``
####################

A state that needs to be met to trigger the given stride pipeline. The state
states resolved dependencies where each entry in the resolved dependency
listing is described as:

* ``name`` - optional package name that has to be stated in the resolved
  dependency listing
* ``version`` - optional package version in a form of version specifier that
  has to be stated in the resolved dependency listing
* ``index_url`` - optional package index from which the given package is
  consumed, can be negated using "not"

To run the given stride, all the packages in the resolved dependency listing
need to be present in the resolved software stack.

It is possible to provide a listing of match criteria when the given stride pipeline
unit run logic can be applied for multiple matched criteria.

Stride ``run.log``
##################

Print the given message to logs if the pipeline unit is included and run.

See :ref:`boot's log <boot_run_log>` that has shared semantics.

Stride ``run.stack_info``
#########################

See :ref:`stack info <boot_stack_info>` which semantics is shared with this unit.

Note stack info is added only once even if the pipeline unit is
run multiple times during the resolution process.

Stride ``run.not_acceptable``
#############################

If the given pipeline unit is registered and matched, it will discard the
resolved stack matched from the resolver's results reported.

Stride ``run.eager_stop_pipeline``
##################################

If the given pipeline unit is registered and matched, it will cause the whole
resolution to halt and report back any results computed.

Wraps
=====

Declaring :ref:`pipeline units of type wrap <wraps>`.

The following example shows all the configuration options that can be applied
for a wrap pipeline unit type. See respective sections described below for more
