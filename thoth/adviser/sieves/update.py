"""A sieve for filtering out Python packages that are not part of a new release.

This pipeline unit is registered only if adviser was requested to run to check a new
package release. The pipeline unit filters out all the packages except for the one that
should be included in the stack (the newly released) to check whether there is a stack
with the released package that is better than the one used with an older release.
