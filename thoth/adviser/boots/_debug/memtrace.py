"""A boot that traces memory consumption of the adviser/dependency-monkey run.

This pipeline unit was designed to trace memory consumption of an adviser
or dependency-monkey run to spot possible unwanted memory usages. The pipeline
unit adds additional overhead so it is never registered implicitly and *must* be
explicitly turned on by a user (e.g. by providing explicit pipeline configuration).
