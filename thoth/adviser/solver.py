"""Definition of package resolution based on precomputed data available in graph.

There are defined primitives required for offline resolution. This off-line
resolution is done based on data aggregated in the graph database so thereis
no need to perform resolving by actually installing Python packages (as this
version resolution is dynamic in case of Python).
